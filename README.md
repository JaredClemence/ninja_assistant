# NINJA ASSISTANT
## Overview
This is a side-project by Nick Magazzi and Jared Clemence to create a tool that implements Ninja Selling (TM) techniques. Our goal is to design something that is useful to our personal sales businesses that we can share with other members of our brokerage and use to track performance at weekly meetings.

## Version Goals

### Release 1.0 - Estimated December 31, 2019
For release 1.0, we are aiming toward basic functions. A user can upload contact information, and the assistant will select thirteen random contacts each day. From the contact screen, the user can dial the contacts and make notes about each call. Our intended release date is December 31, 2019.
