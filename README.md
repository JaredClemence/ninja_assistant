# NINJA ASSISTANT
## Overview
This is a side-project by Nick Magazzi and Jared Clemence to create a tool that implements Ninja Selling (TM) techniques. Our goal is to design something that is useful to our personal sales businesses that we can share with other members of our brokerage and use to track performance at weekly meetings.
